    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- Overfitting occurs when a model is trained to fit the training data too closely, \n",
    "resulting in a model that is too complex and unable to generalize well to new, unseen data. \n",
    "This can lead to poor performance on the test set and a model that is not useful for real-world applications. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets. \n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation can be used. \n",
    "To mitigate underfitting, techniques such as increasing model complexity, adding more features, or using a more powerful model can be used."

    "Ans:-Some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models include analyzing the learning curves, cross-validation, and regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization. Learning curves plot the training and validation error as a function of the number of training examples, and can help to identify overfitting or underfitting by examining the gap between the two curves. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data, which can help to detect overfitting or underfitting by examining the variation in performance across the folds."

    "which add a penalty proportional to the absolute value or squared magnitude of the model parameters, respectively. \n",
    "These techniques help to prevent the model from overfitting by encouraging the model parameters to be small or sparse. Another common technique is dropout, which randomly drops out units in the neural network during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features."
